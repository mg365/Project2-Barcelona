## Project Description
Barcelona cannot be concieved as such if Immigration is not considered. Not only there are plenty of Catalans and Spaniards that move to the Catalonian capital but also a large percentage of the population is foreign. This project analyses

## Questions & Hypotheses

In this project the followiong questions were asked:
- What is the percentage of immigrants living in certain neighbourhoods? And percentage by nationality?
- Is there a link between the country of origin of immigrants and the Barcelona's neighbourhood chosen to live?
- Do immigrants from less developed (or more developed) countries end up in the “worst” (or the "best") neighbourhoods?
- What could define a better or worse neighbourhood?
- Does the quality (bad,normal,good,etc) of the neighbourhood relate with its death rate? and with the birth rate?
- Do the neighbourhoods with higher births or higher population have more schools or hospitals? what about the other facilities (parks, sports centers,etc)
